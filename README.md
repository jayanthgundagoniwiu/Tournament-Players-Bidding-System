# Tournament-Players-Bidding-System
The Tournament Players Bidding System is a web app for bidding on players inspired by the IPL. Players register, teams bid, and viewers access info. The team has expertise in Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They expect to finish by April with the challenge of deciding which team to sell to if the highest bid is the same.
